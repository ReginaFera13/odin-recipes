    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <Li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</Li>
        <Li>4 lamb shanks</Li>
        <Li>1 onion, chopped</Li>
        <Li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</Li>
        <Li>2 carrots, chopped</Li>
        <Li>2 celery ribs, chopped</Li>
        <Li>2 tbsp tomato paste</Li>
        <Li>14 oz beef broth</Li>
        <Li>12 floz stout</Li>
        <Li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</Li>
        <Li>3 sprigs fresh parsley</Li>
        <Li>1 bay leaf</Li>
        <Li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</Li>
        <Li>salt and pepper to taste</Li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large, wide pot over medium-high heat until oil begins to smoke. Sear lamb shanks in hot oil on all sides until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove lamb shanks and set aside. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <Li>Add onion and garlic to the Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in carrots, celery, and tomato paste; cook for 5 minutes more.</Li>
        <Li>Return lamb shanks to the Dutch oven and pour in broth and stout beer. Use kitchen twine to tie together thyme, parsley, and bay leaf into a secure bundle; add to lamb shanks. Bring to a boil.</Li>
        <Li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lamb is tender and nearly falls off the bone, 2 to 3 hours. Stir in rosemary sprig and season with salt and pepper during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Remove rosemary sprig and herb bundle before serving.</Li>
    </ol>
